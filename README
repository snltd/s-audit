s-audit is designed to help you manage Solaris networks. At its core is the
client; a shell script which is run on any host you wish to audit, and which
produces clear, human-readable output, or a machine-parseable audit file
describing that host.

Copy that audit file to a machine which has the s-audit interface installed
on it, and that host is described in a series of easy-to-understand grids,
which give you at-a-glance overviews of your hardware/virtualization, O/S
revisions and configurations, filesystem layouts and usage, and much more.

The s-audit interface also dynamically generates IP address maps, and lets
you compare machines, helping you track down the kinds of configuration
inconsistencies which can lead to problems.s-audit is designed to help you
